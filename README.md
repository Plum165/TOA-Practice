# ToA Practical Practice

This repository contains my **Theory of Algorithms (ToA) practical practice** work.  
It includes both a **user-friendly version** for personal testing and a **solution version** formatted exactly how the **automarker** expects.

---

##  Overview

The goal of this repo is to prepare for ToA practicals by:
- Writing, testing, and refining algorithmic solutions.
- Comparing a clean, interactive version against the strict automarker format.
- Ensuring that the submitted code passes all automated tests while still being easy to understand.

## Branch Structure

| Branch | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **main** | The *user-friendly version* â€” includes comments, formatted output, and improvements for readability and understanding. |
| **solution** | The *automarker-compliant version* â€” matches the format and structure required for automated grading. |

You can switch between them to see both the clear explanation and the exact submission version.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a **learning and practice space** for developing:
- Algorithmic problem-solving skills.
- Understanding of automarker requirements.
- Ability to write both production-level and submission-level code.
