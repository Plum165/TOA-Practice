Problem Description
Write a program that, given a positive integer, N, and a non-negative integer, Z, counts the number of pairs of positive integers X and Y (0<X, Y<N) for which (X * Y) *modulo* N == Z.

The modulus (or modulo) operation finds the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example: 8 *modulo* 3 is 2. (This is expressed in C, C++, and Java with the % operator, so 8 % 3 == 2.)

Example
Given that N = 6 and Z = 3, the following pairs of integers would be counted, giving an answer of 5:

1, 3
3, 1
3, 3
3, 5
5, 3

Note that the order within the pair matters. For example, (1, 3) and (3, 1) are counted as distinct pairs.
